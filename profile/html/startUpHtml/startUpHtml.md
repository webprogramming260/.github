# Start up deliverable - HTML

Now that you have learned the basics of HTML, is time to structure your startup application. This includes all of the pages, headers, footers, images, and content necessary to represent what your application will do. The application doesn't have to do anything, but there should be a placeholder for everything that you application will do.

You will want an HTML file for each of the main components of your application. The default component of your application should be represented in a file named `index.html` since that is the file a browser will load by default. Here is what the Simon example pages look like.

You will want a similar layout. Make sure you have a placeholder for all the technologies that you will eventually need to represent in your application. This includes:

- **Authentication**: An input for your user to create an account and login. You will want to display the user's name after they login.
- **Database data**: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Simon, this is the high scores of all players.
- **WebSocket data**: A rendering of data that is received from your server. This maybe realtime data sent from other user's (e.g. chat or scoring data), or realtime data that your service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores). For Simon, this represents every time another user creates or ends a game.

The following is a possible layout of the main pieces that your application should have. Note that you do not have to have four HTML pages. You should create the number of pages that makes sense for your application. This maybe only one, or it could be many.

At this point your application will look rather strange because it doesn't have any styling to make it look right. That is fine. You are just focusing on structure and content placeholders in this deliverable.

You must use the same start up GitHub repository that you created for the previous deliverable. Update the README.md file with things that you learn as you work on your start up. As you make changes to your HTML commit those changes and push them to GitHub. You will need at least four commits to get full credit, but in reality you should have many more than that.

Remember to use the `Live Server VS Code extension` to see what your code looks like in the browser. Also use the browser's debugger window to debug your HTML.

Once you have developed your application to where you want it, you need to release it to your production environment. **Copy** the `deployFiles.sh` script from the [Simon HTML repository](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-html/blob/main/deployFiles.sh) to your start up repository and use `startup` for the service parameter (`-s`)

```sh
./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup
```

For example,

```sh
./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s startup
```

Doing this will make this deliverable of your start up available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.

### Update your website's home page

You should also update your website's home page with a link to your project so that you can access everything you have done for this class from the home page. This will make a great portfolio of all your work in this class. You can easily do this by modifying the index.html file that is part of the website-html repository that you created in the earlier instruction and deploying it using the script found in that repository. Make sure you run this script from a console where your working directory is the website-html repository and not your start up repository.

```sh
./deployWebsite.sh  -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain>
```

## â˜‘ Assignment

1. Create the HTML deliverable of your start up application. Make sure all authors of the code are attributed in the application and that there is a link to your GitHub repository.
1. Represent all of the content and structure that your final application will need.
1. Include placeholders for all of the technology that your application will eventually represent.
1. Make sure your main HTML file is named `index.html` so that it will load by default.
1. Periodically commit and push your code to GitHub.
1. Periodically update your start up repository's README.md file to reflect what you have learned and want to remember.
1. Push your final version of your project to GitHub.
1. Deploy your start up application to your production environment (your server).
1. Make sure your application is available from your production environment.
1. Upload the URL to your start up application to the Canvas assignment.
