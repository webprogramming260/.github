# Components

ðŸ“– **Recommended reading**: [React.dev - Your First Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)

React components allow you to modularize the functionality of your application. This allows the underlying code to directly represent the components that a user interacts with. It also enables code reuse as common application component often show up repeatedly.

## The render function

One of the primary purposes of a component is to generate user interface. This is done with the components `render` function. Whatever is returned from the render function is inserted into the component HTML element.

As a simple example, a JSX file containing a React component element named `Demo` would cause React to load the `Demo` component, call the render function, and insert the result into the place of the `Demo` element.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>
  Component: <Demo />
</div>
```

Notice that `Demo` is not a valid HTML element. The transpiler will replace this tag with the resulting rendered HTML.

**React component**

```js
function Demo() {
  const who = 'world';
  return <b>Hello {who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello world</b></p>
```

## Properties

React components also allow you to pass information to them in the form of element properties. The component receives the properties in its constructor and then can display them when it renders.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>Component: <Demo who="Walke" /><div>
```

**React component**

```jsx
function Demo(props) {
  return <b>Hello {props.who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello Walke</b></div>
```

## State

In addition to properties, a component can have internal state. Component state is created by calling the `React.useState` hook function. The useState function returns a variable that contains the current state and a function to update the state. The following example creates a state variable called `clicked` and toggles the click state in the `updateClicked` function that gets called when the paragraph text is clicked.

```jsx
const Clicker = () => {
  const [clicked, updateClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const onClicked = (e) => {
    updateClicked(!clicked);
  };

  return <p onClick={(e) => onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${clicked}`}</p>;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

You should note that you can use JSX even without a function. A simple variable representing JSX will work anyplace you would otherwise provide a component.

```jsx
const hello = <div>Hello</div>;

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Class style components

In addition to the preferred `function style` components demonstrated above, React also supports `class style` components. However, you should note that the React team is moving away from the class style representation, and for that reason you should probably not use it. With that said, you are likely to see class style components and so you should be aware of the syntax. Below is the equivalent class style component for the Clicker component that we created above.

The major difference is that properties are loaded on the constructor and state is set using a `setState` function on the component object.

```jsx
class Clicker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicked: false,
    };
  }
  onClicked() {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  }
  render() {
    return <p onClick={(e) => this.onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${this.state.clicked}`}</p>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

## Reactivity

A component's properties and state are used by the React framework to determine the reactivity of the interface. Reactivity controls how a component reacts to actions taken by the user or events that happen within the application. Whenever a component's state or properties change, the render function for the component and all of its dependent component render functions are called.

## â˜‘ Assignment

Create a fork of this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/Yzvaver) and experiment.

Try the following:

1. Add a new property to the Demo component that provides the background color for the component.
2. Add another state variable that changes the color on a mouse over event.

When you are done submit your CodePen URL, along with a comment about something you found interesting, to the Canvas assignment.

### ðŸ§§ Possible solution (spoilers!)

If you get stuck here is a possible solution.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      Function Style Component: <Demo who='function' color='yellow' />
    </div>
  );
}

const Demo = ({ who, initialColor }) => {
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState(initialColor);
  const [outlook, setOutlook] = React.useState('beautiful');

  function changeOutlook() {
    setOutlook(outlook === 'exciting' ? 'beautiful' : 'exciting');
  }

  function changeColor() {
    var randomColor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16);
    setColor('#' + randomColor);
  }

  return (
    <div className='component' onMouseOver={changeColor} style={{ background: color }}>
      <p>
        Hello {outlook} {who}
      </p>
      <button onClick={changeOutlook}>change</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
