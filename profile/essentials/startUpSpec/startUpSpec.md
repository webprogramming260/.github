# Start up deliverable - specification

Your start up application demonstrates your mastery of the instruction presented by this course. Make sure you put significant effort into coming up with a simple yet interesting idea. Your application needs to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, calling web services, providing web services, authentication, storing data persistently, using web sockets for peer to peer communication, and running as a progressive web application.

Create an elevator pitch for your application. Something that would excite an investment firm if you happen to catch a ride up the elevator with one of their representatives. Or maybe just sound cool to your friends if they are your target audience. This should be no more than a paragraph in length.

Then sketch out what the application looks like. You can use a tool like [NinjaMock.com](https://ninjamock.com/) to quickly produce a rough layout. Google docs, or plain old paper works fine too (just take pictures for your submission).
